## More?

I've been working on a retention feature (see [/beta_retention_localstorage](https://github.com/jobano/hsbc-account-history-rerender.user.js/tree/beta_retention_localstorage)
It's working now but I'll let it aside as it's a bit special... (keep all your bank records in your localStorage for later consultation)
